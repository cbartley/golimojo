                ... Rhodes spends a great deal of time at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge, the marvelous site where so many discoveries were made in the early 20th Century. Giants walk the pages of Rhodes' book: men like J.J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr, Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, Leslie Groves, Vannevar Bush, and Albert Einstein all make important appearances throughout the book. ...

                ... Rhodes devotes a number of pages to the personal histories of the giants of science who came to the U.S. to work on the Manhattan Project. We learn about the early lives of Leo Szilard and Edward Teller in Germany, Niels Bohr in Denmark, Albert Einstein in Germany, and many others. Eventually, many of these lives came to intersect with the Third Reich of Nazi Germany. Many of these scientists decided to leave Europe for Britain or the United States. ...

Or, for that matter, about Capgras delusion (the unnerving sensation that an impostor is sitting in for a close relative), the Boston molasses disaster, the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, Bill Gates’s house, the forty-five-minute Anglo-Zanzibar War, or Islam in Iceland. Wikipedia includes fine entries on Kafka and the War of the Spanish Succession, and also a complete guide to the ships of the U.S. Navy, a definition of Philadelphia cheesesteak, a masterly page on Scrabble, a list of historical cats (celebrity cats, a cat millionaire, the first feline to circumnavigate Australia), a survey of invented expletives in fiction ("bippie," "cakesniffer," "furgle"), instructions for curing hiccups, and an article that describes, with schematic diagrams, how to build a stove from a discarded soda can. The how-to entries represent territory that the encyclopedia has not claimed since the eighteenth century. ...

The style of the amphorae strongly suggested that the ship had called at the island of Rhodes, also on the eastern edge of the Hellenistic world, and known for its wealth and its industry. Given the reputed corruption of officials in the provinces of the Roman Empire, it is possible that the ship’s cargo had been plundered from Greek temples and villas, and was on its way to adorn the houses of aristocrats in Rome. The sheer weight of the cargo probably contributed to the ship’s destruction. ...

Native populations in the Americas lacked immunities to common European diseases like smallpox, measles, and mumps. Within 20 years of Columbus's arrival, smallpox had wiped out at least half the people of the West Indies and had begun to spread to the South American mainland. ...

According to the new chronology, the Late Bronze Age civilizations in the Aegean and on Cyprus may have developed in association with 18th- and 17th-century Canaanite and Levantine civilizations and their expanding maritime trade world. These cultures were very different from the Egyptians’ in terms of culture, language and religion. ...
